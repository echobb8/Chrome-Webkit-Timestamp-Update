# Chrome/Webkit Timestamp Update

This is a python script that will take a Chrome History file and update the start_time and end_time timestamps which are in webkit timestamp format into a human readable format. You can update the table(s) and column(s) information as needed.


USAGE:

Specify the path to your Chrome _History_ file in the **sqlite_file** variable, or leave it as is and run this script from the same folder that contains the _History_ sqlite database file.

```sh
python dbedit.py
```
